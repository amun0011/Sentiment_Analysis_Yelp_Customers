    "This project is about sentiment analysis of customer reviews of Yelp. In order to do this the following datasets have been provided -\n",
    "1. **train data.csv:** trn id and review text. Contains 650,000 product reviews which acts as the training data.\n",
    "2. **train label.csv:** trn id and sentiment labels. The label set (1,2,3,4,5) refer to positive polarity levels (strong negative, weak negative, neutral, weak positive, strong and positive) respectively.\n",

    "3. **Feature Selection:** The next step is feature selection. In this step, adequate features are selected for the sampled dataset.\n",
    "4. **Train/Test Split:** Because we do not have any labelled test data to check our accuracy, so we need to do train test split to understand the model accuracy.\n",
